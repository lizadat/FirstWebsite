Class in Interactive Media & My First Website

* Project Name:
My project is called "The importance of friendship", which was created based on 30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF). 

* Project Description + Process: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create:
The main point of 30MFF is to create a short movie which tells a story in 30 minutes: 15 minutes shooting the videos and 15 minutes editting. Although, such system did not work in my group with Pranav and Pavly. It took us 15 minutes first to come up with the idea for our project, 20 mins shooting the videos and aroung 30 minutes editting.
To find an interesting idea for the video we started our brainshtorm: what do we have around that can be used. It appeared that both me and Pranav had soft toys. What do they symbolize? - Happiness, friendship... Both of these were our goals for the video.
The video itself is about 2 toys that were studying and feeling only on campus in the evening. They decided to meet and had great time together. Sometimes in yourr life you need to take a break and spend it with your frineds.
As a result of this video I had to create a website presenting this video.
My first sketch looked very poor: just images and text. However, as a first ever website it still looked okay. After showing it in the class and getting the feedback I new how to make it better.
I added colors, image overlay with text, some interactivity in the "to top" button (when you reach the bottom of the page and want to go up - you ca press the button and it will take you to the top) as well as the textarea with the possibility to leave a comment.

* Details:
Font: "Copperplate", "Courier New", Fantasy;
Colors: yellow(#ffef78), white(#ffffff), linear-gradient(rgba(97, 252, 255, 0.2), rgba(97, 252, 255, 1) (blue color, but change in transperancy).

* Reflection/Evaluation: 
I think my goal of creating a website which motivates people to watch my video was achieved. My biggest fear was to not be able to find the balance: there might be too much of details, interactivity, colors etc that would distract the user or that the website will be poor and not interesting. I believe that it is the part of user experince that can be for sure improved with the time and practice. 
The huge part in my website goes to images. Unfortunately, when making I did not think of them: I was just taking short videos and not pictures, which made me later took the screenshot of the video (for sure they were not good-quality images) or compose the set again.
Adding to that, this is my first website and all the things I implemented I learn while implementing. Googling and surfing w3schools website helped me a lot. 
Certainly, there are many things that can be improved, but the final result that I have seems to be nice.
